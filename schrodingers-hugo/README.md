# Schrodingers Library Website
*powered by Hugo*

*...testing Hugo for our website...*

## Installation
To be able to run Hugo, follow the steps [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)

After installing. Clone the repository and run `hugo server` from the path `../schrodingers-library/schrodingers-hugo`

## Change themes
Hugo allows you to change themes whenever you want. You can download more from [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/). We are currently using **Universal Theme**. Follow the files structure from the `exampleSite` folder in any of the themes. Some of the themes will read files differently, so you may have to replace and change the extension of some files (for example from markdown to json)
