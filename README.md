# Schrodingers-9 Library

## Purpose
Schrodingers Library was originally designed as a project for COMP 3350 (Software Engineering 1) at University of Manitoba.

Our aim is to build a very simple and intuitive online book ordering system. See [VISION.md](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2019/schrodingers-library/blob/master/documents/VISION.md) to know more

## Instructions

Download the apk [here]. You are also free to clone this project and run it from Android Studio.

After intalling **Schrodingers Library**, you will be able to browse through our catalog. If you are looking for a specific book, search for the book with the use of the search bar.
We won't force you to create an account with us if you only want to see the books available and their ratings, but you can create an account if you would like to use our app at its full potential. This will allow you to order books, have a purchase history, wishlist and be able to rate/sumbit a review for a book.
To create an account go to `My Account` in the main menu, logout of any currently logged account, then `Create an account`by filling out the information required and you are done!
Before purchasing a book please double check if your payment and address are updated. You can do that through the checkout or `My Account`.
If you would like to get some book recommendations, go to the `Book Recommendations` option in the main menu.
