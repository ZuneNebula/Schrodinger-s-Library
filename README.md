# Schrodingers-9 Library

## Purpose
Schrodingers Library was originally designed as a project for COMP 3350 (Software Engineering 1) at University of Manitoba.

Our aim is to build a very simple and intuitive online book ordering system. See [VISION.md](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2019/schrodingers-library/blob/master/documents/VISION.md) to know more

## Instructions

Download the apk [here]. You are also free to clone this project and run it from Android Studio.

After installing **Schrodingers Library**, you should be able to browse through our book catalog. If you are looking for a specific book, search for the book with the use of the search bar.It is not entirely necessary
to create an account with us to view certain app content such as, books available and their ratings. It's essential to create an account if you're going to be using our exclusive features. These features include ordering books, having a purchase history, wishlist and being able to rate/sumbit a review for a book.
To create an account go to `My Account` in the main menu, logout of any currently logged account, then `Create an account`by filling out the information required and you are done!
Before purchasing a book, you would need to verify if your payment and address are updated. This process can be done through the checkout or `My Account` option. There is also
a sorting option on the app. The app allows you to sort the book catalog by price and Title. If you would love to get some book recommendations, go to the `Book Recommendations` option in the main menu.
