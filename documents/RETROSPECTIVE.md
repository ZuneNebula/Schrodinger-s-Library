# Schrodingers-9 Library

## Retrospective

We planned to have the order books feature ready in an earlier iteration, but because of its dependency from other features, we had to delay it. For this last iteration, we planned to have this feature ready, because of its importance to our vision.
We recorded our project’s velocity here:

![Project velocity](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2019/schrodingers-library/blob/master/Project_velocity.png)

In the diagram of the project velocity provided by the team, we have showed in iteration 1 and 2, we have shown the planned time and actual time assigned to each user story (in minutes). 
Considering the diagram, we can see that in iteration 1, we overestimated our abilities, and by  iteration 2, our estimation was definitely better. The project velocity helps tell us as a team mostly about our ability to estimate. 
Looking at the diagrams for both iterations 1 and 2, we have an inconsistent pattern. Our planned time for both iterations were higher than the Actual time, which gives us an insight how on our abilities to estimate. 
The project velocity also help inform about our team’s perception of what we can deliver. For both  iterations 1 and 2 we moved some uncompleted user stories to future iterations, which helps us know to assign fewer user stories to work with as we always are under delivering for each iteration.
With the project velocity at hand, we were able to plan better as we know what are our abilities are when it comes to the estimation of the user stories, what we can deliver at the end of the iteration, 
and also not over delivering as well.
