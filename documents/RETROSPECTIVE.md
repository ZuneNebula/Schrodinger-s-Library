## Retrospective

Looking back at our project, one aspect of the project that has not been as successful as we would have loved it to be was the ‘Order books’ feature. We planned to have the order books feature ready in an earlier iteration, but we had to delay it until the last iteration.  This was because of the features’ dependency on other parts of the project like Account Management (including billing), Shopping cart and the database, which was the most complex part of the project. 
Also, because we overestimated our tasks, we couldn’t have the dependencies ready, so that meant more delay for the order books feature.We planned to fully focus on this feature in this iteration, and even if some of its dependencies had some bugs or were not finished, we focused on all the work done possible so then we only have to worry about putting everything together when other parts were ready.

Also, we had some communication issues for both iterations 1 and 2. In order to ease up the group and let everyone communicate, we had each member of the group pick the user stories they would like to develop. We also used google hangouts, google docs, and slack as means of communication. 
Apart from effective communication, we also welcomed everyone’s ideas in regards to the way things were to be implemented. Though some difficulties were during implementation, having everyone involved, and also being able to detect issues help us work effective enough for future iterations.

In the project velocity’s diagram provided by the team below, we have data for iteration 1 and 2, in which we have  shown the planned and actual time assigned to each user story (in minutes). 
Considering the diagram, we can see that in iteration 1, we underestimated our abilities, and by iteration 2, our estimation was definitely better. The project velocity helped tell us  about our ability to estimate tasks for a big project as a team. 
Looking at the diagrams for both iterations 1 and 2, we have an inconsistent pattern. Our planned time for both iterations were higher than the Actual time, which gives us an insight how on our abilities to estimate. 
The project velocity also helped to inform about our team’s perception of what we can deliver. For both iterations 1 and 2 we moved some uncompleted user stories to future iterations, which helps us know to assign fewer user stories to work with as we were always under delivering for each iteration.
With the project velocity at hand, we were able to plan better for iteration 3 as we know what our abilities are when it comes to the estimation of the user stories, what we can deliver at the end of the iteration, and also considering not over delivering as well.
