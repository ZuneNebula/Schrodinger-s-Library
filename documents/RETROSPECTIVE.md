# Schrodingers-9 Library

## Retrospective

Looking back, one aspect of the project that has not been as successful as we’d hoped was the ‘order books’ feature.

We planned to have the order books feature ready in an earlier iteration, but we had to delay it until the last iteration. We thin is is because of the features’ dependency on other parts of the project like Account Management (including billing), Shopping cart and the database, which was the most complex part. Also, because we overestimated our tasks, we couldn’t have the dependencies ready, so that meant a more delay for Ordering.
What we planned for this iteration is to fully focus in this feature, and even if some of its dependencies had some bugs or were not finished, we focused in have all the work done possible so then we only have to worry about putting all together when other part is ready

In the project velocity’s diagram provided by the team, we have data for iteration 1 and 2, in which there are shown the planned time and actual time assigned to each user story (in minutes). 
Considering the diagram, we can see that in iteration 1, we overestimated our abilities, and by iteration 2, our estimation was definitely better. The project velocity helped to tell us how is our ability to estimate tasks for a big project as a team. 
Looking at the diagrams for both iterations 1 and 2, we have an inconsistent pattern. Our planned time for both iterations were higher than the Actual time, which gives us an insight how on our abilities to estimate. 
The project velocity also helped to inform about our team’s perception of what we can deliver. For both iterations 1 and 2 we moved some uncompleted user stories to future iterations, which helps us know to assign fewer user stories to work with as we always are under delivering for each iteration.
With the project velocity at hand, we were able to plan better as we know what our abilities are when it comes to the estimation of the user stories, what we can deliver at the end of the iteration, and not over delivering as well.
